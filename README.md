## Authors

FPGA250 is an FPGA designed by [UC Berkeley's CS250](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs250/fa20/) class of Fall 2020:

- our names here

## Overview

The FPGA comprises three basic tile types:

- MAC, a multiply-accumulate unit
- CLB, configurable logic blocks
  - each contain 4x S44 LUTs
- SRAM, a flexibly-shaped SRAM block
